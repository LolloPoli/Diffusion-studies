# Diffusion studies

Particle diffusion studies at ePIC.

PROGRAM NAME:
- 1prova.C -> Diffusion calculations as a function of different kinematic variables (important for the TMDs).
- run_all.C -> It is Necessary to run all the files at once, since the main file uses a chain to connect all the data.
- combined.cpp -> Compine all the canvas and plots produced in one file.
- efficiency.cpp -> Calculate the relative fraction of particles. Also measures the MC ID reconstruction and the Reco x PID efficiencies as a function of the kinematic variables of interest.
